Qno 4.Q4. Discuss the precedence and associativity of operators in JavaScript. Why is understanding these concepts important?
 sol : Precedence and associativity are fundamental concepts in JavaScript that determine the order of operations in an expression.
       Understanding these concepts is crucial for writing correct and predictable code, especially when dealing with complex expressions.
	1. Precedence:
	   Precedence defines the order in which different operators are evaluated within an expression.
	   Operators with higher precedence are evaluated first.
	   Similar to math, multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction.
	   Example:let result = 2 + 3 * 4;
		Due to precedence, multiplication (3 * 4) is evaluated first, resulting in 12.
		Then, addition (2 + 12) is performed, resulting in the final answer of 14.
	2. Associativity:
	   Associativity specifies the grouping order for operators with the same precedence.
           Left-to-right associativity: operators are evaluated from left to right when they have equal precedence.
           Right-to-left associativity: less common, operators are evaluated from right to left.
	   Example:let result = 5 - 2 - 1;
		Both subtraction operators have the same precedence, but due to left-to-right associativity, the expression is evaluated as:
		(5 - 2) - 1
		3 - 1
		2
	Precedence and evaluated are important because it gives:
	* Predictable Code.
	* Avoiding Errors.
	* Writing Efficient Code.
