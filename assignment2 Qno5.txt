Question no 5: Explain the importance of comments in JavaScript and provide examples of single-line and
	       multi-line comments.
 Solution: Comments are essential elements in JavaScript code for several reasons:
	   * Improved Readability
	   * Better Maintainability
     	   * Documentation
	Single-line comments:  These comments start with two forward slashes (//) and extend to the end of the line. Anything written after // on that line is ignored by the JavaScript engine.
	Example:JavaScript
		let message = "Welcome!";  // This is a single-line comment
	
	Multi-line comments:  These comments are used for longer explanations or commenting out code blocks. They start with /* and end with */. Everything between these markers is ignored by JavaScript.
	Example:
		/*
		This function calculates the area of a rectangle.
		It takes two arguments: width and height.
		*/
		function calculateArea(width, height) {
   		 return width * height;}
