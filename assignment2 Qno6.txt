Question 6: Explain the importance of choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript.
	    Provide an example where using a clear identifier improves code readability.
Solution : Choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names is a fundamental best practice in JavaScript for several reasons:
		* Enhanced Readability.
		* Improved Maintainability.
		* Better Collaboration.
	Example: Consider this code
		let celsiusTemperature = 25;
		let fahrenheitEquivalent = celsiusTemperature * 1.8 + 32;
		console.log("The temperature in Fahrenheit is:", fahrenheitEquivalent);
	The revised code with clear names like celsiusTemperature and fahrenheitEquivalent makes the purpose and logic self-evident.
        You can instantly understand the conversion process without needing additional comments.
