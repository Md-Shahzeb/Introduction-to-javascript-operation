Question 2: Explain the key differences between JavaScript and HTML.
            Provide examples of situations where you would use each.
 solution:- The Key difference between JavaScript and HTML are following:
	HTML:- HTML is used to create the structure and content of a web page,
	       HTML uses markup tags to specify elements.
	       Creates static web pages. The content remains the same unless the entire page is reloaded.
	Examples of Use: You would use HTML to define the following on a webpage:
                      Headings (h1, h2, etc.).
                      Paragraphs.
                      Images.
                      Lists.
                      Tables.
                      Links to other web pages.
	JavaScript:- JavaScript is used to add dynamic behavior and engagement.
	             JavaScript uses scripting language syntax.
		     JavaScript is used to add interactive elements that engage users.
		     JavaScript is lightweight.
	             Enables dynamic web pages. You can update content, styles,
                     and respond to user interactions (like button clicks) without reloading the page.
	Examples of Use::  You would use JavaScript for things like:
			Creating interactive forms (e.g., validate user input before submission)
			Adding animations and visual effects
			Creating image sliders or carousels
			Building single-page applications (SPAs) where the content updates without reloading
			Responding to user actions (e.g., button clicks, mouse movements)
